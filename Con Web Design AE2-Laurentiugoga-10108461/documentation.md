## Introduction

Stress and anxiety have become common problems for students. Balancing academic obligations, societal responsibilities, and personal well-being may be difficult. However, the advancement of technology has resulted in novel solutions to these problems, one of which is a blog app. A blog app may be a great platform for students to properly manage their stress and anxiety, providing them with a variety of advantages that add to their overall well-being. This introduction looks at how a blog app might help students navigate the challenges of everyday life by encouraging self-expression, self-reflection, and interaction with others. Students can find consolation, support, and coping skills for stress and anxiety by utilising the possibilities of a blog app, therefore improving their quality of life and academic accomplishment.
Work-life balance is an important element that has a substantial influence on college students' mental health. Juggling academic duties, extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, and personal commitments may put students under a lot of stress. Finding a happy medium between these many characteristics is critical for their overall well-being and college experience.
This project aims to provide a platform for university students to deal with stress and anxiety by sharing their experiences and thoughts through blog posts.
React Stress and Anxiety Blogs is a single page application (SPA) built with React.js that supports university students in dealing with stress and anxiety. It provides a platform for users to login, view a dashboard, and create posts to share their experiences and thoughts.


## Methodology

User-Centered Design (UCD) is a human-centered approach that acknowledges the critical role of people in the design and development process. UCD strives to produce products and services that correspond with users' expectations by prioritising their requirements, preferences, and behaviours, resulting in improved usability and user satisfaction.
The core of UCD is a thorough understanding of the users gained via extensive user research. This study uses a variety of approaches, including interviews, questionnaires, and observations, to provide insights into user objectives, motivations, and pain areas. Designers may find chances for improvement and innovation through empathising with people and understanding their requirements.
User stories are an essential component of the User-Centered Design (UCD) process, giving designers a thorough grasp of how consumers will engage with the product or service. These narratives go beyond mere task descriptions to explore the consumers' underlying motives and expectations.

Adopting UCD can result in better user happiness, usability, and the production of products that fulfil user demands. It emphasises the significance of user-centered thinking in developing products that are appealing to consumers and contribute to a pleasant user experience.
To create user stories, you must first establish the user's goals, behaviours, and expected outcomes within the context of the product or service. Designers may acquire significant insights into the precise demands and pain areas that drive user behaviour by expressing the user's perspective. A user story for a blog app may be something like, "As a student, I want to easily draught and publish blog posts so I can share my thoughts and experiences with a larger audience."

## Technology Stack

The Stress and Anxiety Blogs project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React.js**: The project is built using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js provides a component-based architecture, allowing for modular and reusable code.
